1.0.3 (trunk):
* Don't attempt to remove base-* packages which will always fail (#93)
* Complete the Appveyor CI scripts to be on-par with those for Travis CI (#101)

1.0.2 (2016-03-01):
* Docker: Update package metadata before installing depexts (#80)
* Docker: Refresh origin OPAM repository to latest master upon build (#79)
* Better detection of `opam` files. Some repos can contain multiple `opam`
  files (e.g. mirage/mirage contains mirage and mirage-types), so we need
  to look for `<pkg>.opam`.

1.0.1 (2016-01-08):
* Lint opam file before pinning to avoid edit loops (#75)

1.0.0 (2016-01-05):
* Initial opam release
